1. user presses a key to start
2. random button glows
    - added to trueSequence
3. user selects a button
    - added to sequence
    - check to see if it is correct
        - if correct check to see if lengths match
            - if correct check to see if sequence == trueSequence
                - if it does select another random button
                - else game failed
            - else check to see if sequence [0 -> i] == trueSequence [0 -> i]
                - if it does wait for next user input
                - else game failed
4. repeat 2+3 until game lost
